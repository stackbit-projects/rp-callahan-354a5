Check out my new [paper](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GL088322) out in *Geophysical Research Letters*. The paper presents a new approach that aggregates geophysical estimates of porosity from seismic refraction surveys to quantify a site-wide perspective of subsurface weathering. The paper has important implications for quantifying weathering and subsurface water storage capacity across landscapes.
