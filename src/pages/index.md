      I am a PhD candidate working with Dr. Cliff Riebe at the University of
      Wyoming. My dissertation focuses on quantifying how subsurface weathering
      influence geomorphic and ecological processes. More specifically, I have
      worked on quantifying how hillslope weathering influences, hillslope
      erosion, and river incision over millennial timescales in the southern
      Sierra Nevada, California. I have also worked on quantifying weathering
      over hillslope scales using near-surface geophysical techniques.
      Additionally, I have integrated near-surface geophysical methods and
      remote sensing measurements to quantify how subsurface weathering
      influences ecosystem productivity and drought response during the historic
      2011-2017 drought in the southern Sierra Nevada, California. My research
      has greatly benefitted from transdisciplinary collaborations through the
      Southern Sierra Critical Zone Observatory and the recently funded [Bedrock
      Critical Zone Collaborative Network](https://bedrockczn.github.io/). For
      more information on my research check out my publications. Also, feel free
      to reach out to me at [rcallaha@uwyo.edu](rcallaha@uwyo.edu) with any
      questions.
